# To-Do List Application

## Description
The To-Do List Application is a simple console-based program that allows users to manage their tasks. Users can add, remove, and view tasks along with their corresponding IDs. This application helps users organize their daily activities and keep track of what needs to be done.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list with a unique ID.
- **Remove Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list by entering the task's ID.
- **View All Tasks**: Users can display all current tasks along with their IDs.
- **Persistence**: The application saves the task list to a file (`todo.txt`) when the program exits.
- **Testing**: The program includes built-in tests to verify the functionality of the task management features.

 **Interact with the Application**:
   - Follow the prompts in the console:
     - Enter `+` followed by a task to add a new task.
     - Enter `-` followed by the task ID to remove a task.
     - Enter `?` to display all current tasks.
     - Enter `%` to exit the program and save the task list.
